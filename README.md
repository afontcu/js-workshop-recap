# JS Workshops Recap

On August 2018, Trivago made [this contest](https://tech.trivago.com/2018/07/23/win-a-spot-in-a-5-day-javascript-workshop-with-kyle-simpson/)
where external people could apply for a free spot by filling a PR to either
Webpack or Babel.

I was fortunate enough to win, so I could attend to a 5-day JS workshop in DÃ¼sseldorf.

This repo contains notes, ideas, code snippets and questions that I decided to
write down. This is not a complete transcription of the workshops. It's just
an opinionated version of what Kyle taught us and what I believe I should wirte down.

If you want to enjoy the full JS workshop experience, [FrontendMasters has your back](https://frontendmasters.com/kyle-simpson/).

## Why this repository?

Mainly because I do really want to learn the stuff Kyle showcased in the workshops.

There's this thing called [Forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).
This theory states that _"Humans tend to halve their memory of newly learned knowledge in a matter of days or weeks unless they consciously review the learned material"_.

So this is my attempt to beat the curve, to retain as much information as possible.
